      <h3>Audra Auclair</h3>
	
			 <div class="row">
     <div class="column"><p>My work has been influnced by a number of different arists, designers, musicians and one off pieces of work. The first thing that comes to mind for my influences would have to be the colour themes of Audra Auclair. Audra is a Canadian gouache painter who gave me my first taste of colour heavy art. Before first seeing Auclair's art I didn't think much about painting or art in general. I remember one day in secondary school getting frustrated with my homework and, wanting to do something I never do, I sat down with my mam's old paints I found in the attic and started to look for something to paint. I looked around on the internet for a while, scowering for something I liked, and Auclairs works came up. They blew me away at the time and still to this day.  </p>

      <h3>Simon Stålenhag</h3>
	
			 
     <div class="column"><p>Another key inspiation in my work comes from the digital artist Simon Stålenhag. His works feature heavy cyber-dystopian themes. I find his work to be very facinating and detailed and he uses the normality of his human figures to contast the wonder of his colossus sci-fi creations. I feel like his inspiration comes through with my visual effects on certain images. I became obsessed with his work, looking to buy his table-top games and watching his show called "Tales from the loop" on Prime Video. I just wanted to see anything that could expand on the story he created with his works. </p>
